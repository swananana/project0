<p>  Are you happy? Happiness is a simple feeling. Being happy is supposed to be be the easiest thing we can do. But why are so many people sad? What is happiness to you? If you ask a 4 year old kid, it's probably a chocolate or a toy. But as we grow older why do we complicate happiness? Why can't happiness be an icecream on a rainy day? why can't happiness be flowers in full bloom? why can't happiness be looking at the sunset ? why can't happiness be looking at your mum waking you up? why can't happiness be eating from your friends lunch box? why can't happiness be completing your favorite book or series? why can't happiness be fitting into the perfect jeans? why can't happiness be gaining a few kgs of weight?  why can't happiness be loud music in your car? why can't happiness be singing your loved one to sleep? why can't happiness be a big hug from your best friend? why can't happiness be.... simple? everyone not even exaggerating everyone expects happiness to be big. And we're disappointed when happiness is simple and small. And hence we push away this small happiness and feel grumpy and complain that we have the worst life ever. But wait for a minute, and look at your perfect life. Everyone's life is perfect if you think it is perfect but if you stay dissatisfied with everything, you will never be truly happy. And tbh Happiness is the ultimate goal. So if you lost someone today, stop letting it crush you because that person would want you to be happy. If you fought with your best friend, go sort it out. life is too short to not have a best friend. If you broke up, Distract yourself and enjoy the new freedom. if you got cheated on, know that you deserved better. If you failed a test, it's okay just tell yourself that you'll work harder. You never know when this sad life of yours will end. And you can't afford to waste time on the sad things. Go look for happiness. And trust me you will find it. And when you smile through your pain, the pain will automatically let you go. THE WORLD ISN'T A WISH GRANTING FACTORY. So be happy with all you've got. If happiness is a choice why aren't you making it?
